                    <p class="my-2" style="text-align: justify;"> <span class="fw-bold">Abstract:</span> I model the transactions that take place in
                        an electronic marketplace where both adverse selection and moral hazard problems are present. A
                        built-in review system is employed within the platform to ease the information problem and
                        provide an incentive for the seller through reputation. Successful and unsuccessful transactions
                        receive reviews with possibly distinct probabilities. These probabilities affect the type of
                        Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium and the effort provided by the seller. I show that when the price
                        is fixed, increasing the likelihood of a successful transaction being reviewed on the platform
                        never decreases the seller's effort, with the possibility of a discrete jump. By contrast,
                        increasing the likelihood of a failed transaction receiving a review may cause a discrete drop
                        in the seller's effort. The seller's profit is non-monotonous in the probabilities of receiving
                        reviews. Under endogenous price, the seller effort is continuous and non-monotonous in both
                        parameters of the review system.

                    </a>(Job Market Paper)
                    <p class="my-2" style="text-align: justify;"> <span class="fw-bold">Abstract:</span> In the recent decade, we witnessed a
                        significant expansion of online commerce (e-commerce). Today, a consumer can find any product
                        online from many other suppliers without geographical limitations in addition to the local
                        supplier of the products. Hence, consumers who need a product have two options: They can go to
                        the local market and choose the product that fits best to their interest upon observing
                        available products or can search online until they believe they have found the appropriate
                        product and purchase it. This option of the consumer brings in another dimension to the market.
                        The sellers of two environments (local and online) with comparative advantages compete for the
                        consumers' demand. Once in the brick-and-mortar seller's shop, the consumer can physically
                        inspect the product and try it on if needed and find the best-fitting alternative according to
                        her preferences.
                        On the other hand, if the consumer decides to search for the product online, she has to visit
                        the product's web page to get familiar with its features. Considering the vast number of online
                        alternatives, a consumer who sequentially inspects the online products cannot ensure finding the
                        best-fitting alternative. Instead, she has to decide if the product is good enough such that it
                        is not worth searching for the next alternative. In the second chapter of the thesis, I aim to
                        explore the short-term reaction (price) of the brick-and-mortar retailers who are competing
                        against each other a la Hotelling to the competition against a perfectly competitive online
                        market when the consumers are heterogeneous with respect to their distance to the shops and
                        online search costs.

                        Advertising”
                    </a> (Job Market Paper)
                    <p class="my-2" style="text-align: justify;"> <span class="fw-bold">Abstract:</span> There is an ongoing debate around what is
                        the best practice for personal data protection or data privacy. It is a highly multidisciplinary
                        topic, and the debate touches on many vital issues. There are many aspects coming from the
                        literature of business, law, ethics, and human rights. My main goal is to provide an economic
                        perspective to the debate around personal data protection. The targeting advertisement is one of
                        the major sectors where personal data is capitalized. Indeed, in almost all websites and social
                        media, fine-tuned tailored ads are shown to the users based on their characteristics.
                        Informative Advertising is argued to be informative for the consumers and generate a more
                        competitive environment. On the other hand, targeted advertising can distort the consumers’
                        information inflow and hurt competition by generating markets where sellers have virtual market
                        power by accessing the consumers who are willing to pay the highest price for their products and
                        charge higher markups. Moreover, the traditional advertising expenditure can be wasteful because
                        it does not have an efficient trade turnover, while targeted advertisement resolves the issue by
                        reaching consumers with the highest likelihood of purchasing.
                        In the digital advertising business, the market power is concentrated on the big tech companies
                        with continuous access to vast consumer data. These intermediary advertisement providers have
                        access to data from both sides of the product market, and the market power of the intermediary
                        may enable the information flow control. Depending on how data flows from one side to another,
                        the product market can have different outcomes. Therefore, my question is, does the targeting
                        capability of Ad intermediaries affect the outcome of product markets without having an active
                        role in the product market? Furthermore, does the market power in the Ad business can generate
                        markets with higher markups and fewer socially beneficial trades? The objective of the third
                        project is to find answers to these questions. For this purpose, I set up a theoretical model
                        that reflects the characteristics of advertising mentioned above. I show that the targeted
                        advertising improves total welfare created in the product market compared to random advertising,
                        given that the marginal advertising costs are equal. The cost of the targeted advertising is
                        passed to the consumers through the price but not random advertising; therefore, the product
                        price is higher with targeted advertising. However, the sellers’ advertising expenditure is more
                        efficient with targeting, which dominates the decrease in consumer welfare. The targeted
                        advertising enables a market with a low-valued product while the market fails if only random
                        advertising is available. If the market is functional with either type of advertising, consumers
                        prefer random advertising since the price is higher with targeted ads than random ads, and fewer
                        consumers purchase.
